# Windows Time Synchronization Detection Script
# 
# Description:
# This script detects if Windows Time synchronization is properly configured.
# It checks:
# 1. Windows Time service state
# 2. NTP server configuration
# 3. Recent successful synchronization
# 4. Poll interval setting
#
# Usage:
# Use as the detection part of an Intune Remediation script
# - Exit code 0 = No issues found
# - Exit code 1 = Issues found, remediation needed
#
# Version History:
# 1.0 - 2025-03-06 - Initial script creation
# 1.1 - 2025-03-06 - Improved date parsing to handle different regional formats
#                   - Added more robust sync status detection based on multiple indicators
